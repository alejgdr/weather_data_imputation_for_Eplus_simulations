These are the steps you need to follow to make a simulation with the imputed data files.

Step1: Transform the csv you imputed, so it can have the format needed to make an EPW.
       For this, the only neccesary thing to do  is to run  the notebook on 
       01_imputation/06_exporting_csv_for_epw.ipynb
       Change the path of the variable 'imputed_file' and  of the 'to_epw_file'
       
Step 2: Building the .def file
        On E+ documentation auxiliary programs> weather converter are some templates to the .def file
        Or use a template you already have, and just modify the variables quantity and/or order, as well 
        as their respective units.
        Don't forget to name the .def file with the same name as the .csv file you want to epw.
        
Step 3: Building the epw
        With  'Weather Statistics and Conversions' built in program from E+ (commonly on windows) it can 
        the epw can be build only by selecting the csv from the files of your computer.
            (In this case from 01_weather_data/03_imputing_process/03_to_EPWs)
        And to output the EPW file on 01_weather_data/03_imputing_process/04_EPWs.
 
Step 4: Simulation
       En 05_simulation_imputation/02_simulation...
       Using the built EPW, simulate the desired building, it can be only on OpenStudio.
       It's important to Select the year that you have originally in your weather file.
       Be sure to report an exterior variable (Site Outdoor DryBulb Temperature, or Solar Radiation) 
       so it can be verified that the EPW was created correctly.
       
Step 5: Data comparison and preprocessing for analysis 
       In the notebook 05_simulation_imputation/03_simulation_analysis/01_simulation converter
       Where it would be checked if the epw and original weather data are the same.
       And you can change the name of the file so it can be registered as your base simulation
       or imputed with x method simulation (variable-> exported_simulation_data)
       Also this notebook changes the names of the columns so it is more managable on the analysis.
       
Step 6: Analysis imputation 
        In 05_simulation_imputation/03_simulation_analysis/02_simulation_metrics.ipynb
        Stablish the exported csv from the previous step, 
        If you changed the imputed days, you would have to recover them from the LSTMCNN_imputation.ipynb 
        notebook and put them on a list from where the imputation is started.
